/**
* Problem: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
* Definition:
*   Now, palindrome means any word or sequence that reads the same forwards as backward.
*   A palindrome linked list is a type of linked list where the elements of the list read the same forwards and backward.
* Example:
*   Original linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
*   If you reverse the linked list, it remains the same: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
