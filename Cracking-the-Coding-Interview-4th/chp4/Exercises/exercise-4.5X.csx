/**
  Problem: Given a binary tree and a node, write a program to find in-order successor of this node.

  This problem is similar to the one describes in exercise-4.5. 
  While exercise-4.5 seeks to find the in-order successor for a binary search tree(BST), 
  this exercise seeks to find the in-order successor for a biinary tree (BT).
